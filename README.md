A very simple chat script written in PHP.
To work requires server and database - chat.sql, the whole configuration is in the file actions/config.php
The chat is largely anonymous - it does not support accounts. Users are verified by rewriting a captcha code generated by the server.
Hobby project, you should not use it in public. Unless you really want to, who am I to prohibit you.
